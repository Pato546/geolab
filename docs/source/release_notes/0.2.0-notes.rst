``geolysis`` 0.2.0 Release notes
********************************

``geolysis`` **0.2.0** is the first stable release. The python
versions supported are 3.10 - 3.12.


Features
========

- Performing soil classification using ``USCS`` and ``AASHTO`` 
  standards.
- Correcting Standard Penetration Number (SPT) N-values using 
  various correction methods such as ``energy correction``, 
  ``overburden pressure correction`` and ``dilatancy correction``.
  Also, analysing SPT N-values and finding a representative SPT
  N-value from the foundation influence zone can be performed
  using ``SPT corrected weightage average`` and 
  ``SPT uncorrected average``.
- Allowable Bearing Capacity can be performed using bearing
  capacity theories established by ``Bowles (1997)``,
  ``Meyerhof (1956)``, and ``Terzaghi (1948)``.
- Estimating soil parameters such as ``soil unit weight``
  (moist, saturated, submerged), ``compression index``, ``soil
  friction angle``, and ``undrained shear strength`` from other
  parameters such as ``SPT N60``, ``liquid limit``, ``void ratio``
  etc.
