======================

``geolysis`` is an open-source software for geotechnical engineering analysis that offers 
a suite of powerful tools and features for soil analysis and modeling. 

Some of the features ``geolysis`` provides are:

- Provides soil classification based on ``USCS`` and ``AASHTO`` standards.
- Bearing capacity analysis can be performed, both from results obtained from **laboratory** 
  or **field**.
- Estimates important soil engineering properties.
- Settlement analysis tools to predict and model soil settlements under various loads and 
  conditions.
- Supports finite element modeling of soil behaviour under different conditions.

.. note::

   The available features as of the |release| release are:

   - Provides soil classification based on ``USCS`` and ``AASHTO`` standards.
   - Bearing capacity analysis can be performed, both from results obtained from **laboratory**
