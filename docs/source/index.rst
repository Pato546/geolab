What is ``geolysis``?
=====================

``geolysis`` is an open-source software for geotechnical analysis
and modeling. It provides features such as ``soil classifications``
(based on the ``USCS`` and ``AASHTO`` classification standards),
estimating ``soil bearing capacity`` using the SPT N-value, and
estimating soil engineering parameters such as ``soil unit weight``
(``moist``, ``saturated``, and ``submerged``), ``compression index``,
``soil internal angle of friction``, and ``undrained shear strength of soil``.

**Features to include in upcoming versions:**

- Settlement analysis
- Discrete element method (DEM)
