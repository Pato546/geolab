About geolysis
**************

``geolysis`` is your one-stop shop for all your geotechnical engineering
solutions, ranging from site investigation and laboratory test analysis
to advanced geotechnical designs.

``geolysis`` is divided into four (4) main parts:

#. ``geolyis.core (Python Package)``

   ``geolysis.core`` is an open-source Python package that provides features
   for analyzing geotechnical results obtained from field and laboratory
   tests. ``geolysis.core`` is designed specifically to assist developers
   in building applications that can solve complex geotechnical
   problems.

   Whether you're working on soil mechanics, rock mechanics, or any other
   geotechnical field, ``geolysis.core`` provides a powerful set of tools
   that can help you design and develop robust solutions. With an
   intuitive API and a wide range of features, this software is an
   essential tool for anyone who needs to work with geotechnical data on
   a regular basis. Whether you're a seasoned geotechnical engineer or a
   new developer just getting started in the field, ``geolysis.core`` is
   the ideal solution for all your software development needs.

   Some of the features implemented so far include soil classification,
   standard penetration test analysis (such as SPT N-design and SPT
   N-value corrections), and calculating the allowable bearing capacity of
   soils from Standard Penetration Test N-values. There are more features
   underway, which include settlement analysis, ultimate bearing capacity
   analysis, etc.

   ``geolysis.core`` is the foundation application on which other parts of the
   application will depend. Developers can also use ``geolysis.core`` to power
   their applications.

#. ``geolysis.ui (Qt, PySide6)``

   ``geolysis.ui`` is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) which will enable
   users to graphically interact with ``geolysis``. User will be able to
   input data and view generated plots, such as ``PSD`` curves,
   ``Atterberg Limits`` plots, ``Compaction`` curves, etc within the
   application.

#. ``geolysis.excel (Javascript & Others)``

   ``geolysis.excel`` provides a Microsoft Excel add-in for simple geotechnical
   analysis. *More on this later.*

#. ``geolysis.ai (Python, Pytorch & Others)``

   ``geolysis.ai`` explores the use of Artificial Intelligence (**AI**) in
   enhancing productivity in Geotechnical Engineering.

Motivation
==========

``geolysis`` is a software solution that aims to support geotechnical
engineers in their daily work by providing a set of tools that makes
them perform their tasks in a more efficient and effective manner.
Moreover, the platform is designed to educate civil engineering
students, especially those who specialize in geotechnical engineering,
by exposing them to industry-relevant tools and techniques that will
help them become industry-ready professionals as soon as they graduate.
With ``geolysis``, users will be better equipped to handle geotechnical
challenges, make informed decisions, and improve their overall
productivity.

Vision
======

At ``geolysis``, we are committed to being your go-to source for all your
geotechnical engineering needs.

Mission
=======

The ``geolysis`` team is currently working on ``geolysis.core``, a robust
and efficient framework that will serve as the foundation for all upcoming
applications. ``geolysis.core`` is designed to provide a wide range of features
and functionalities, making it a powerful tool for developers looking to
create innovative and high-performance applications. With ``geolysis.core`` at
the heart of their projects, developers will be able to create cutting-edge
applications that leverage the latest technologies and deliver exceptional
user experiences.
