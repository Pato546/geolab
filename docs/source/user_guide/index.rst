Important Notice: Pre-Alpha Stage of Development
================================================

We would like to inform you that our project is currently in the **pre-alpha stage** of development. 
This is an early phase where we are actively working on developing the core features and 
functionalities of our software.

**What this means for you:**

#. **User Guide Incomplete**: As we are still in the process of defining and building the key components 
   of our software, the User Guide is not yet fully developed. This means that the documentation you find 
   here may be incomplete or subject to significant changes.

#. **Expect Changes**: Since we are in the pre-alpha stage, please be aware that aspects of the software, 
   including features, api, and user interface, are likely to undergo substantial revisions. We are 
   constantly iterating and improving based on internal testing and early feedback.

#. **Your Feedback is Valuable**: Although the User Guide is not complete, we highly value early feedback 
   from users like you. If you are exploring our software at this stage, your insights and experiences are 
   incredibly important to us.

#. **Stay Updated**: We are working hard to progress to the next stages of development, where we will have 
   a more stable and feature-rich version of our software. We encourage you to stay connected with us for 
   future updates and releases.

We appreciate your interest and understanding as we navigate this early and crucial phase of development. 
Your patience and support are instrumental in helping us create a better and more reliable product.

Thank you for being part of our journey!
