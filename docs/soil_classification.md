It is important to characterize soils to be able to assess their engineering properties such as:

- Bearing capacity
- Compressibility
- Permeability

**Particle Size Distribution (PSD)** and **Atterberg Limits** are tests developed for characterizing soils quality.

## Particle Size Distribution (PSD)

The range of particle sizes in a sample of material is referred to as the particle size distribution. It is commonly measured using sieve analysis techniques, which entail using a stack of sieves to measure the size of the particles in a sample and graphing the results to illustrate the distribution of the particle sizes. The particle size distribution can provide important information about the materials' physical characteristics.

The distribution of grain sizes affects the engineering properties of the soil.

- A single grain-sized soil cannot be compacted to a high density, which results in a lesser shear strength.
- Soils with grains spanning a wide size distribution can be compacted to a high density resulting in a high shear strength.

## Atterberg Limit

## Unified Soil Classification System (USCS)

The Unified Soil Classification System was first developed by Casagrande in 1948, and later in 1952, was modified by the Bureau of Reclamation and the Corps of Engineers of the United States of America. The system has also been adopted by American Society of Testing Materials (ASTM). The system is the most popular system for use in all types of engineering problems involving soils.

- It is similar to the Cassagrande's Classification System.
- It uses **Particle Size Distribution** and **Atterberg Limits** for classification.
- It is commonly used for engineering projects.
- Soils are group into:

  - Coarse grained
  - Fine grained
  - Highly Organic Soils

- Soil symbols:

  - G: Gravel
  - S: Sand
  - M: Silt
  - C: Clay
  - O: Organic Clay
  - Pt: Peat

- Liquid limit symbols:

  - H: High Plasticity (LL > 50)
  - L: Low Plasticity (LL < 50)

- Gradation symbols:
  - W: Well-graded
  - P: Poorly-graded
