geolysis is an open-source library for geotechnical analysis and modeling.

The geolysis library is among four main projects: `geolysis.gui`,
`geolysis.excel`, and `geolysis.ai`. The geolysis library powers all of these
projects.

**_All three projects are currently in their early stages and are not available
to the public_**.

**_Active development of `geolysis` occurs on the `dev` branch. For more
information on the lastest features of `geolysis`, switch to the
`dev` branch_**.

Here are brief descriptions of these projects:

1. `geolysis.gui` is a graphical user interface that allows users to interact
   with the geolysis library. Through this interface, users can view generated
   reports and visualizations, such as Particle Size Distribution (PSD) curves,
   Atterberg Limits plots, and Compaction curves, etc. Additionally, it enables
   users to conduct foundation analysis and design, among other functionalities.

1. `geolysis.excel` is an add-in for Microsoft Excel that performs simple
   geotechnical analysis. It offers some features similar to `geolysis.gui`
   within Microsoft Excel.
1. geolysis.ai offers machine learning models that are trained using
   geotechnical data.

## Installation

```shell
   pip install geolysis
```

<!--
## Motivation

`geolysis` is a software solution that aims to support geotechnical engineers in
their daily work by providing a set of tools that makes them perform their tasks
in a more efficient and effective manner.

Moreover, the platform is designed to educate civil engineering students,
especially those who specialize in geotechnical engineering, by exposing them to
industry-relevant tools and techniques that will help them become industry-ready
professionals as soon as they graduate.

With `geolysis`, users will be better equipped to handle geotechnical
challenges, make informed decisions, and improve their overall productivity.
