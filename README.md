# `soil_classifier`: A Python Package and Microsoft Excel Add-In for soil classification.

`soil_classifier` uses **Unified Soil Classification System (USCS)** and the **American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO)** system to classify soils.

It is important to characterize soils to be able to assess their engineering properties such as:

- Bearing capacity
- Compressibility
- Permeability

**Particle Size Distribution (PSD)** and **Atterberg Limits** are tests developed for characterizing soils quality.

# Particle Size Distribution (PSD)

The range of particle sizes in a sample of material is referred to as the particle size distribution. It is commonly measured using sieve analysis techniques, which entail using a stack of sieves to measure the size of the particles in a sample and graphing the results to illustrate the distribution of the particle sizes. The particle size distribution can provide important information about the materials' physical characteristics.

The distribution of grain sizes affects the engineering properties of the soil.

- A single grain-sized soil cannot be compacted to a high density, which results in a lesser shear strength.
- Soils with grains spanning a wide size distribution can be compacted to a high density resulting in a high shear strength.
