`geolab` is an open-source software for geotechnical engineering that offers a suite of
powerful tools and features for soil analysis and modeling. It provides soil classification based
on both USCS and AASHTO standards, bearing capacity analysis, estimation of soil engineering properties,
settlement analysis, and finite element modeling. The software assists geotechnical engineers in their
day-to-day work, enabling them to perform a wide range of tasks with ease and make informed decisions
about design and construction. `geolab` enhances efficiency and effectiveness, allowing engineers to
design and build better projects with confidence.

## Features

- Provides soil classification based on `USCS` and `AASHTO` standards.
- Bearing capacity analysis can be performed, both from results obtained from **laboratory** or **field**.
- Estimates important soil engineering properties.
- Settlement analysis tools to predict and model soil settlements under various loads and conditions.
- Supports finite element modeling of soil behaviour under different conditions.
