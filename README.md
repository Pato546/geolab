## What is geolysis?

`geolysis` is an open-source software for geotechnical analysis and modeling.
It provides features such as soil classifications
(based on the `USCS` and `AASHTO` classification standards), estimating soil
bearing capacity using SPT N-value, and estimating of soil engineering parameters
such as Soil Unit Weight (moist, saturated, and submerged), Compression index,
soil internal angle of friction, and undrained shear strength of soil.

**Features to include in upcoming versions:**

- Settlement analysis
- Finite element modeling

The motivation behind `geolysis` is to provide free software to assist geotechnical
engineers in their day-to-day work and to expose civil engineering students
(especially geotechnical students) to tools that can make them industry-ready
geotechnical engineers right from college.
