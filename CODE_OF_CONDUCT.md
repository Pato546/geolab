# `geolab` Code of Conduct

## Introduction

Welcome to [Project Name]! We are committed to creating a respectful and inclusive
community for all contributors. This Code of Conduct outlines our expectations for
behavior within our community, both online and in-person, as well as the consequences
for unacceptable behavior.

We expect all participants in our community to adhere to this Code of Conduct. If you
have any concerns or experience any violations of this Code, please contact the project
maintainers at <boatengpato.pb@gmail.com>.

## Our Standards

We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free and inclusive experience for everyone,
regardless of age, gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability,
physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, nationality, religion, or any other
characteristic.

Unacceptable behavior includes, but is not limited to:

- **Harassment:** Any form of unwelcome behavior, whether verbal, written, or physical,
  that intimidates, threatens, or demeans individuals or groups. This includes offensive
  comments, slurs, and personal attacks.
- **Hateful Conduct:** Promoting or advocating for discrimination, hatred, or violence
  against individuals or groups based on any of the characteristics mentioned above.
- **Disruptive Behavior:** Intentionally disrupting discussions, events, or the community
  atmosphere, including trolling, spamming, or incitement to do so.
- **Invasion of Privacy:** Posting private information about others without their consent.
- **Plagiarism:** Presenting someone else's work, ideas, or code as your own without proper
  attribution or permission.
- **Sexual Harassment:** Unwanted sexual advances, comments, or attention. Consent is crucial;
  if it's not explicitly given, it's not consent.

## Enforcement

Violations of this Code of Conduct may result in corrective actions, including, but not limited to:

- **Verbal Warning:** The project maintainers may issue a private, written warning to
  the individual(s) involved, explaining the violation.
- **Temporary Suspension:** In more serious cases or after multiple violations, the
  individual(s) may be temporarily suspended from community participation.
- **Permanent Ban:** Repeated or severe violations may result in a permanent ban from the
  community.

The project maintainers have the sole discretion to determine the appropriate response to any
conduct they deem unacceptable.

## Reporting

If you believe someone is violating this Code of Conduct or have concerns related to the conduct of any
community member, please contact the project maintainers at <boatengpato.pb@gmail.com>. All reports will
be treated confidentially.

violation, please reach out to us for guidance and support.
